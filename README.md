# My Blog - A Modern Markdown-Powered Blog Platform

This is a modern, minimalist personal blog platform that turns simple Markdown files into beautiful blog posts. Perfect for developers, writers, or anyone who wants to maintain a clean, professional blog without the complexity of a traditional CMS.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required packages by running: `npm install`
4. Start the blog by running: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## 💡 What Makes This Blog Special?

This blog platform is built with modern technologies that make it both powerful and easy to use:

### Core Technologies Explained

#### 1. Node.js & Express
- **What is it?** Node.js is a platform that lets you run JavaScript on your computer (not just in browsers). Express is a framework that makes it easy to create web applications with Node.js.
- **How we use it:** Our blog uses Express to:
  - Handle web requests (when someone visits your blog)
  - Serve your blog posts
  - Manage routing (directing visitors to the right pages)

Example of how Express works in our code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// When someone visits the homepage
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('home');
});
```

#### 2. Markdown
- **What is it?** A simple way to write formatted text using plain text. Instead of buttons like in Microsoft Word, you use simple symbols:
  - `# Title` creates a heading
  - `**bold**` makes text **bold**
  - `- item` creates bullet points
- **How we use it:** Write your blog posts in Markdown files (`.md`), and they automatically get converted to beautiful web pages.

Example of Markdown:
```markdown
# My Blog Post Title

This is a **bold statement** about my blog.

## Key Points:
- First important point
- Second crucial idea
```

#### 3. EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- **What is it?** A template system that lets us create dynamic HTML pages.
- **How we use it:** We use EJS to:
  - Create consistent layouts across your blog
  - Show your blog posts in a beautiful format
  - Add dynamic content like dates and post lists

Example of EJS in action:
```ejs
<h1><%= post.title %></h1>
<div class="content">
    <%- post.content %>
</div>
```

#### 4. Highlight.js
- **What is it?** A tool that makes code in your blog posts look pretty with syntax highlighting.
- **How we use it:** When you include code in your blog posts, it automatically gets colored and formatted to be easily readable.

Example of code that will be highlighted:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
